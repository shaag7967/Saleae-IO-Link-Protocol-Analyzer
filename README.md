## External python modules

The IO-Link Safety Protocol Analyzer uses the following python modules:
- iolink_utils (not published yet)
- [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)

These are already included (see directory `lib`) and do not need to be installed manually. 

They were integrated into this HLA by the following commands:
```
pip install lxml --target ./lib
pip install iolink_utils --target ./lib
```
